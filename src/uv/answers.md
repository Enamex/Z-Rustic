1. User-Agent string:

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3107.4 Safari/537.36
```

| Segment | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
`Mozilla/5.0` | Historical; indicates browser is compatible with Mozilla browsers (most (all?) browsers now include it no matter their connection to Mozilla).
`(Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64)` | Host system: Kernel and Architecture (in this case, `Windows NT 6.3` indicates Windows 8.1, `x64` refers to the CPU architecture used by the OS).
`AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)` | Version of Web Kit used as part of the rendering engine of the browser. KHTML is an open source HTML layout engine developed by the KDE project.
`Chrome/60.0.3107.4 Safari/537.36` | Version of actual browser (Chrome) and... version of Safari that uses the same version of WebKit?
